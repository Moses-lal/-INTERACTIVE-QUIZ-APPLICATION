## Description for the Quiz 

*Overview*

NeuroQuiz is a sleek, interactive web-based quiz application designed to engage users with a seamless and enjoyable trivia experience. Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project offers a polished interface where users can test their knowledge across various topics, receive instant feedback, and track their scores. The application dynamically loads questions, provides visual cues for correct and incorrect answers, and includes a results summary with a restart option, making it ideal for educational purposes, casual learning, or simply having fun.

Users receive instant feedback—green for correct answers, red for incorrect ones with the right answer displayed. The app tracks scores and presents a final summary (e.g., "You scored 4 out of 5!"). Features include hover effects on options, a restart button, and a modern design with a light blue theme, making it ideal for educational or casual trivia fun.

*Features :-* 

NeuroQuiz comes packed with user-friendly features to ensure an engaging experience:

Dynamic Question Loading: Questions are loaded dynamically from a predefined dataset, allowing for a smooth transition between questions without page reloads.

Instant Feedback: Upon selecting an option, users receive immediate feedback—correct answers are highlighted in green with a "Correct!" message, while incorrect answers are marked in red, displaying the correct answer for learning.

Scoring System: The app tracks the user's score throughout the quiz and displays the final score at the end, giving a clear performance summary (e.g., "You scored 4 out of 5!").

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the quiz is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Interactive UI: Options are styled as buttons with hover effects, and the interface uses Font Awesome icons for a modern look. The color scheme (light blue background, green/red feedback) enhances visual clarity.

Restart Functionality: After completing the quiz, users can restart with a single click, resetting the score and question index for a fresh attempt.
